This repository is for CS551P assessment

The web application shows the football match results of top tournaments in the footballing world.

The first page shows the list of all the top tournaments.
Upon clicking any of the names/links of the tournaments, the user is shown all the matches played in the tournament from a specific
timeline, which is since 2013. 

Further clicking on the link which says ‘view goal details’ shows all
the goal scorers' names and related data to the user. This is how a user can view the results of
the matches they want to check and view.

No extra commands or path ways are to be followed to use the web application as it very straight forward after the app is up and running.
